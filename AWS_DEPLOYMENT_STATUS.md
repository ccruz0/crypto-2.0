# AWS Deployment Status - Price Threshold E2E

## ✅ Completed

1. **Unit Tests**: All 8 tests passing locally
   - Validates throttle logic for 10%, 11%, 3%, and 0% thresholds
   - Can run without Docker

2. **Code Implementation**: 
   - Structured logging with `evaluation_id` ✅
   - Price injection endpoint `/api/test/inject-price` ✅
   - E2E Playwright test created ✅
   - All code committed ✅

3. **AWS Deployment**:
   - Backend code deployed to AWS ✅
   - `ENABLE_TEST_PRICE_INJECTION=1` set in `.env.aws` ✅
   - Endpoint is accessible (returns proper error messages) ✅
   - Route is registered (`/api/test/inject-price`) ✅

## ⚠️ Known Issue

**MarketData Scoping Error**: The price injection endpoint has a Python scoping issue where `MarketData` is being shadowed. 

**Error**: `"cannot access local variable 'MarketData' where it is not associated with a value"`

**Root Cause**: The file in the Docker container still has old code with:
- Line 1142: `db.query(MarketData)` should be `db.query(MarketDataModel)`
- Line 1158: `from app.models.market_data import MarketData` should be removed
- Line 1159: `MarketData(` should be `MarketDataModel(`

**Fix**: The local file has the correct code (uses `MarketDataModel` alias), but the Docker build isn't picking it up because the backend-aws service doesn't use a volume mount.

**Solution Options**:
1. Rebuild Docker image with correct file (recommended)
2. Add volume mount temporarily for testing
3. Fix file directly in container (won't persist across restarts)

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Fix MarketData scoping**: Ensure Docker build includes corrected file
2. **Test endpoint**: Verify price injection works correctly
3. **Run E2E test**: Execute Playwright test against `https://dashboard.hilovivo.com`
4. **Verify logs**: Check structured logging appears correctly
5. **Document results**: Update audit report with final results

## 🚀 Test Command (When Fixed)

```bash
# On AWS server:
cd /home/ubuntu/automated-trading-platform/frontend
DASHBOARD_URL=https://dashboard.hilovivo.com ENABLE_TEST_PRICE_INJECTION=1 npx playwright test tests/e2e/price-threshold-e2e.spec.ts --timeout=120000
```

## 📊 Current Status

- **Phase 0**: ✅ Complete
- **Phase 1**: ✅ Complete  
- **Phase 2**: ⚠️ 95% complete (minor scoping fix needed)
- **Phase 3**: ⏳ Pending
- **Phase 4**: ⏳ Pending

**All core functionality is implemented and deployed. Just need to fix the MarketData scoping issue to complete Phase 2.**
